# python-challenge3

I got the push for GITHUB to work!! 

This was a fun project and I finally got the hang of it by the end of it. I know that you're going to look at my PyPoll code and I'll lose points because it is currently unfinished. 

However, I was able to move pretty quick to that point following the PyBank one. I think on a slow week, I will go back and complete. I'm just happy to have the gitpush work, so I can upload last weeks homework.
